A Semi-supervised Machine Learning Approach for Open Star Cluster Member Determination

**Abstract**

The members of an open star cluster are often hard to distinguish from the field star in the same area of the sky and various machine learning (ML) methods have been used to solve the problem. This paper proposes a semi-supervised ML model, where we can use an unsupervised model to generate a training data and then use that to train a supervised model. First, I justified the choice of evaluation metrics that can be used to compare between models to find the best one. As an example, I applied Gaussian Mixture Model and Random Forest for M67 and a new cluster NGC 3766. I discussed the best practices to justify the decisions while running a model including feature selection and model hyperparameter optimizations. Lastly, I conclude with laying out the future directions.
